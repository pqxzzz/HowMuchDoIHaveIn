## This is a personal project created for studying, utilizing knowledge in `HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ReactJS, NextJS, and Tailwind CSS`.

In this project, you choose which currency you want in the title 'How Much do I Have In \_\_\_,' and just below, you select the amount and the currency you currently have.

The API that this application queries is: [RapidAPICurrencyConverter](https://rapidapi.com/apininjas/api/currency-converter-by-api-ninjas).

If you don't know which currencies are available, below the main Div there is a link that leads to a page with all possible currencies for reference.

When the result is checked, the converted money is dynamic. If you convert a value that's higher than the value you entered, the new value will be displayed in green; if it's lower, it will be in red.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm install >>> npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
